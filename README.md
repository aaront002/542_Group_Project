# Computational Thinking for Governance Analytics Project
## PUBPOL 542
**By Spencer Leo, Trevor Press, and Aaron Tam**

This project examines the correlations between countryâ€™s internet availability, mortality rate and fertility rate. 
Our research questions are the following:
- How are these variables related to development?
- Are all three of these variables highly correlated? 
- Are these variables functions of each other?
- Does location influence these variables?

The html files labeled *cleaning* shows the preliminary data cleaning process performed in Python for each dataset. This was performed by each group member individually, so these files reference our individual github repositories. The file called *InterMortFert_Merge* shows the process of merging our datasets together in Python and producing a *TEAMdata.RDS* file for analysis in R. In the file called *Final*, our team performed clustering and regression analysis in R. The background, methods, and findings of our research are summarized and further explained in detail in the *FertMortInt Final Presentation* and *542 Final Paper*.
